by a password. In addition to streaming audio and video from a webcam and
microphone, Camus also provides screen sharing and text chat.

Running
-------

Using Snap
~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure you have `snapd`_ installed. Install Camus:

::

   $ sudo snap install camus

Run Camus:

::

   $ camus

Go to ``localhost:5000`` in your browser. For local testing, you can visit the
same room in multiple tabs and each tab will act as a separate client.

Using Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Camus requires `Python 3.7`_ or higher since it makes use of `Quart`_ and async
syntax. As usual, it's best to use a virtual environment.

Install Camus:

::

   $ pip install camus-chat

Run Camus:

::

   $ camus

Go to ``localhost:5000`` in your browser. For local testing, you can visit the
same room in multiple tabs and each tab will act as a separate client.

Using Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can find a `pre-built Docker image`_ on Docker Hub. Use the following
command to pull the image and run a container:

::

   $ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 mrgnr/camus

Go to ``localhost:5000`` in your browser. For local testing, you can visit the
same room in multiple tabs and each tab will act as a separate client.
